# Multifield-Flow-Model
This Python program simulates a numerical fluid dynamics problem, modeling heat, concentration, and velocity transfer in a two-dimensional flow system. It uses advanced numerical methods like the tridiagonal matrix algorithm to solve complex partial differential equations across multiple time steps.
