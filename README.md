# Multifield-Flow-Model

This Python script is a sophisticated numerical simulation of fluid dynamics, solving coupled partial differential equations for heat, mass, and momentum transfer in a two-dimensional domain. The program discretizes a computational grid with 20x56 points, representing a physical space from 0 to 1 in the x-direction and 0 to 14 in the y-direction. It employs advanced finite difference methods to track the evolution of velocity components, temperature, and concentration across small time increments.

The core of the simulation is a time-stepping algorithm that iteratively solves complex mathematical equations representing fluid behavior. By using the tridiagonal matrix algorithm (tridag), the code efficiently updates multiple physical variables simultaneously, accounting for interactions between fluid motion, thermal transport, and mass transfer. The simulation incorporates dimensionless numbers like Grashof, Prandtl, and Schmidt to characterize the flow's fundamental properties, enabling a comprehensive analysis of buoyancy-driven and forced convection phenomena.

As the simulation progresses, it continuously checks for convergence, terminating when changes in variables become minimal or a maximum time is reached. The program outputs detailed results, including temperature and concentration distributions, velocity field components, and derived quantities like average Nusselt and Sherwood numbers. This approach helps in understanding complex fluid dynamics scenarios, such as natural convection in enclosed spaces, by providing a numerically precise representation of how different physical fields interact and evolve over time.
